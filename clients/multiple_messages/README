To run this example,
just do this:


In Window 0 :

  Start a dispatch router, listening on the standard AMQP port 5672.




In Window 1 :

  go run ./multiple_recv.go



In Window 2 :

  go run ./multiple_send.go




After 3 or 4 seconds, you should see numbers start printing out in the recv window, indicating how many messages have been received.



At the end the sender and receiver will print out the start time and the end time for the test -- in microseconds -- and you can use that to calculate throughput.
